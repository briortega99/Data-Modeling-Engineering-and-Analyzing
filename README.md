# Data-Modeling-Engineering-and-Analyzing
SQL Challenge

  Using QuickDBD I was able to create an ERD to visualize how to go about creating my tables within my database
and in which order to import all of my files. After that, I created my database in postgresql and all of my tables
within my schema. Then, I was able to analyze the data thoroughly to find the different requirements. I was able to use
INNER JOIN to combine multiple tables in order to find the information I needed.
